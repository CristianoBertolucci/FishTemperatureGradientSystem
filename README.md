# FishTemperatureGradientSystem
In this project, we illustrate how to develop an automated system that generates a horizontal temperature gradient in a tank to study behavioral thermoregulation in fish. 

Our system provides an automatic low-cost and user-friendly solution for characterizing thermal preferences in fish. Data will also help researchers to acquire standard behavioural indicator of fish welfare that could be used fr improving husbandry protocols in captive conditions.

For more information on setting up the experimental tank, please see the main text when available (Supplementary Material).


# Get Started
This is the main repository containing three different files. 

Two files are sketch to upload on an Arduino-based microcontroller for generating the horizontal thermal gradient (names files: "MultiSensorTemp_Recording_03Jan2023" and "reading_SensorAdress_03Jan23"). 

The third file is a custom-phyton based sketch for long-term recording fish behaviour (name file: "rtf_fish")
